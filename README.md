## About me

Montreal-born computer science and biology major currently completing an exchange semester at the University of Edinburgh.

In my free time, I like going for long aimless walks and taking pictures to compile into digital and physical collages.
I play a lot of tetris. My username on tetr.io is JELLOMOULD :^)
